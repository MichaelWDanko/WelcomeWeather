# WelcomeWeather
A loading page to start your day. Includes a weather screen to help you plan your day

###Overview: 
I will be working to build a web app that could serve as a default home page for users. The page's initial feature will be a weather app that pulls in data from OpenWeatherAPI and help users plan their day.

###Key Features:
- A single page, multi view site developed using AngularJS.
- I want to pull user's location from their browser and automatically retrieve the information.
- Have multiple user support.
