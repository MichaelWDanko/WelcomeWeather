# WelcomeWeather
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MichaelWDanko/WelcomeWeather.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MichaelWDanko/WelcomeWeather)
A loading page to start your day. Includes a weather screen to help you plan your day

###Overview: 
I will be working to build a web app that could serve as a default home page for users. The page's initial feature will be a weather app that pulls in data from WorldWeatherOnline and help users plan their day.

###Key Features:
- A single page, multi view site developed using AngularJS.
- I want to pull user's location from their browser and automatically retrieve the information.
- A loading screen while the AJAX requests are able to get location data and retrieve the weather information.
